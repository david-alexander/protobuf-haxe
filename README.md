Protobuf-Haxe
=============

**Protobuf-Haxe** is an implementation of Google's *[Protocol Buffers](https://code.google.com/p/protobuf/)* library for the [Haxe](http://haxe.org/) platform.

The project is still in the **very early** stages of development, and further information will be posted here soon.
